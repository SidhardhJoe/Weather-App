## Weather-App
 This is a simple Weather App designed using React-Native with Expo. I devloped this mainly to understand the working of API calling so i havent given much thought into the designing element.
 I have used Weather API for weather forcast, which is easily assessable in the internet.
 Although i have used API i have removed it from the final commit. Make sure to insert API before exceqution.
